## Documentation

### Overview

This C++ program benchmarks the CPU by calculating the square root of a number for a specified number of iterations, measures the time it takes to run, and outputs the results including the elapsed time, CPU speed in GHz, and benchmark score.

### Dependencies

This program requires a C++ compiler and the standard C++ libraries. It uses the `std::chrono` and `cmath` headers to measure time and perform mathematical calculations.

### Usage
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saidofficial/simple-benchmark
```
2. Go to the repository folder
```bash
cd simple-benchmark
```

3. To compile the program, run the following command:
```bash
make
```


This will create an executable file named `cpu_benchmark`. To run the program, simply execute the following command:

```bash
./cpu_benchmark
```
